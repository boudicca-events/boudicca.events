## Visual (Colorblind) 

### Introduction

Someone who is colorblind can still see pigmentation but will have trouble distinguishing between colors. 

Red-green color blindness is the most common and makes it difficult for a person to distinguish between red and green. Green can often look red and red can look like a dull green.

Blue-yellow color blindness is less common and as the name suggests, causes someone to confuse blue and yellow with other colors.

And, in rare cases, a person could have monochromacy, which means they cannot see any colors at all. 

### Why it is important?

The most common form of color blindness affects 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women. 

### Requirements w.r.t WCAG

- Color contrast ratio of at least 4:5:1 for normal text
- Color contrast ratio of 3:1 for larger text
- Color contrast ratio of 3:1 also applies to graphics and user interface components
- Large text is seen as 14 point and larger, or bold
- There are no color contrast requirements for logo 

### Prevent Color Combinations
There are certain color combinations that are particularly difficult for color-blind users to process, so itâ€™s best to avoid them. 
The main color combinations that should be avoided are:

- Green & Black
- Blue & Gray
- Green & Blue
- Green & Brown
- Green & Gray
- Blue & Purple
- Light Green & Yellow
- Green & Red
