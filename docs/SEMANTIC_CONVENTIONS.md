# Semantic Conventions

While most of the core Boudicca Software is very generic (see our [Data Model](DATA_MODEL.md)),
EventCollectors and most Publishers are specialized to work with Events,
and this document describes how Events should look like for them to be interoperable.

### Data types

We define some custom data types we need our properties to be in. The values in () will denote the
underlying [Format Variants](DATA_MODEL.md#format-variant) which are applicable for this data type, ordered by their
priority.
Earlier Format Variants are selected over later ones.

* `text (format=text)`: Simple Text
* `richtext (format=markdown,text)`: Either simple text or markdown for structured text
* `date (format=date)`: [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) Timestamp as text, for
  example: `2009-06-30T18:30:00+02:00`
* `number (format=number)`: A number, for example `1`,`0.5`,`-2`
* `url (format=text)`: A URL as text
* `list (format=list)`: A list of text elements
* `enum<?> (format=text)`: Has to be one of the specified distinct values
* `boolean (format=text)`: The text "true" or "false"

Note: publishers have to be able to handle invalid values by for example simply ignoring them.

### Property List

#### Usage explanation

`MANDATORY`: This field is required for proper operation of boudicca.
`RECOMMENDED`: This field is not required, but it is one of the core features enabling event sorting and filtering for
publishers.
`OPTIONAL`: This field can be used if the information is available.
`DEPRECATED`: This field should no longer be used.

#### Registration enum values

* `FREE`: a free event which neither requires registration nor a ticket
* `REGISTRATION`: an event which requires a free registration
* `PRE_SALES_ONLY`: an event which can only be entered when buying a ticket in advance
* `TICKET`: a paid event which requires a ticket

#### "type" property

type is an open field, so any value is permitted, but this is a list of common/known types:

- concert
- theatre
- meetup
- museum
- museum_railway
- model_railway
- guided_tour
- workshop
- ...

#### "tags" property

tags is an open field, so any value is permitted, but this is a list of common/known tags:

- ...
- TODO
-

#### Category enum values

* `MUSIC`: concerts or other events where the main focus is music
* `TECH`: event with technology as the focus
* `ART`: art exhibitions, comedy, theater, ...
* `SPORT`: everything to do with sports, either watching them or actively participate

#### RecurrenceType enum values

* `REGULARLY`: events that happen about once a week or more often over the period of multiple months
* `RARELY`: events that occur about once a month throughout the year
* `ONCE`: events that occur once a year or more rarely (e.g. Christmas/Easter specials). When the same event is repeated
  e.g. 3 times (for example so that more people can register), but only once a year, it should still be tagged as ONCE.

Examples:

* There is a special event with oldtimers on a museum railway that takes 2 days, but only happens once per year.
    * should be tagged as ONCE
* There is a special event with oldtimers on a museum railway that takes 2 days, but only happens once per year.

    * should be tagged as REGULARLY
* a specific meetup happens about once per month or every two months
    * should be tagged as RARELY

The property name prefix `internal.*` is reserved by Boudicca for internal properties needed and will be silently
discarded if ingested.
